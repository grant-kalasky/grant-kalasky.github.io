		<h1>Dot Labs Web Overhaul</h1>
		<h3>Interaction Designer & Web Developer, January - May 2017</h3>

		<div class="project-section">
			<p>During the Spring semester, my team and I partnered with Dot Labs, a healthcare startup selling the first definitive, non-invasive test to diagnose endometriosis. We worked in conjunction with Dot Labs' CEO Heather Bowerman to design a web experience that would establish the company's brand as well as market its transformative product.</p>

			<p>I was personally responsible for developing the high-fidelity mockups and developing them into responsive webpages.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="project-section">
			<h2>The Problem</h2>
			<p>Many women find the current experience of being diagnosed with endometriosis wrought with doctors minimizing their symptoms, expensive procedures, and years without an accurate diagnosis. Overall, their experiences have been confusing, isolating, and frustrating.</p>

			<p>Dot Labs wants to change this. However, the company lacked a platform to do so. Our team developed a website experience that would showcase the company's innovative diagnostic tool as well as be edifying and supportive for potential patients.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="project-section">
			<h2>User Research</h2>
			<p>In order to better familiarize ourselves with endometriosis and the womens healthcare space, we initially compiled and read an extensive amount of medical and news articles about the disease and those affected by it. Then, we conducted user interviews.</p>

			<p>The primary goal of our research was to best understand two fundamental aspects of the experience of women who suspect they may have endometriosis:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Their experience with medical professionals</li>
				<li>Their interactions with medical diagnostic and treatment websites</li>
			</ol>

			<p>We conducted our research using an online survey which received hundreds of responses. This method was preferable to in-person interviews as it allowed us to access more women with endometriosis ties and maintained the interviewees’ anonymity given the sensitive nature of the topic.</p>

			<p>We targeted endometriosis forums - communities of women concerned about the disease, both those already diagnosed and those looking for more information.</p>

			<p>Some of the questions we asked included:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you use any websites to self diagnose based on symptoms, why do you trust them?</li>
				<li>When learning about a new disease, what information is important to you? (i.e. symptoms, how to diagnose, treatment options, etc.)</li>
				<li>If you self-diagnose using an online resource, would anything prevent you from talking to your doctor about it?</li>
			</ul>

			<p>We found that women who had either been diagnosed with endometriosis or were actively seeking a diagnosis had the following shared experiences:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Not being heard by medical professionals</li>
				<li>Confusion over misinformation about endometriosis found on the internet</li>
				<li>Use popular diagnostic websites but fact checked with personal doctors or medical journals</li>
				<li>Use online groups or forums to build a sense of community with others who had been diagnosed with endometriosis</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Using this information, we developed 3 main user personas:</p>

		<div class="project-section">
			<h2>Objectives</h2>
			<p>Using the research we gathered and the user profiles, we developed the following objectives:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Showcase Dot Labs' revolutionary endometriosis diagnostic test</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Explain the science behind the test in a clear, easily-understandable manner</li>
					<li>Emphasize the test’s user friendliness</li>
					<li>Highlight Dot Labs’ fast turn-around for test results</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<li>Bring clarity to the confusion surrounding misinformation about endometriosis found on the internet</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Provide clear, accurate information and resources regarding endometriosis</li>
					<li>Create a welcoming and empowering atmosphere</li>
					<li>Foster a supportive community that allows women to share their experiences with endometriosis</li>
				</ul>
			</ol>

			<h2>User Flow</h2>
			<p>This is the general userflow that we created to map out the different experiences a user may have with the website.</p>

		<div class="project-section">
			<h2>Style Guide</h2>
			<p>We wanted Dot Lab's brand identity to be one that empowers women. To create such an experience, we chose a strong yellow as our primary color. Yellow is also the ribbon color for endometriosis. We also wanted the website to have a simplistic feel, yet retain scientific validity, so we chose professional and readable typfaces - Roboto and Open Sans.</p>

		<div class="project-section">
			<h2>Screens</h2>
			<p>After experimenting with different visual designs, we opted for a simplistic design. Endometriosis can be confusing and frightening for many. We wanted to alleviate these feelings through clear, concise information and friendly grahpics.

			The rhetoric throughout the site is written with an informative and supporting tone, one that helps to create the edifying and comforting experience Dot Labs hopes to provide its users with.</p>

			<p>Here are the final, responsive web pages we created.</p>

		<div class="project-section">
			<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
			<p>The final screens seen above are going through constant iteration as Dot Labs expands, but all pages including new pages are continuing to leverage the brand identity that our team developed.</p>

			<p>Our final deliverables have allowed Dot Labs to market its revolutionary product and gain increasing attention in press and the women's healthcare space.</p>
