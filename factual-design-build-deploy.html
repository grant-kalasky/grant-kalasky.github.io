						<h6>Overview</h6>
					</div>
					<div class="nine columns">
						<p>During summer 2018, I interned at Factual where I helped redesign an interface that allowed users to manage designs (visualizations of location data) they had created for targeted marketing campaigns. We designed features that would allow users to better manage, deploy, and share their designs.</p>
						<p>I was responsible for designing the experience end-to-end, building interactive prototypes, conducting usability tests, and collaborating with the front-end team to build and launch the MVP.</p>

					<div class="nine columns">
						<p>There are two types of designs: Proximity and Audience.</p> 

						<img class="case-study-img-half" src="DBD/portfolio%20assets/proximity-example.png">
						<img class="case-study-img-half" src="DBD/portfolio%20assets/audience-example.png">
						<p>Think of Proximity designs as geofence visualizations of marketing campaigns. Users can target specific chains, individual locations, or place categories. Audience designs are customer segments created based on real consumer behaviors such as visits to specific places, recency and frequency of visits, and other patterns of behavior.</p>

						<h6>Challenge</h6>
					</div>
					<div class="nine columns">
						<p>Deploying designs to launch a campaign is unintuitive and it’s difficult to manage the designs throughout the deployment process.</p>
						<p>The idea of “Design, Build, Deploy,” a concept Factual used to describe the deployment workflow, was confusing for users. Designs would be created but no other actions would be taken, leaving designs unutilized and marketing campaigns idle. This left users frustrated when they’d go to their respective Demand Side Platforms (DSPs) and couldn’t find their designs. Additionally, users found it difficult to understand the statuses of their designs as they went through the deployment process.</p>
						<p class="block-quote">How might we empower users to take action with their designs, while making design management and deployment more intuitive?</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="design-content-row row">
					<div class="three columns">
						<h6>Understanding complexities</h6>
					</div>
					<div class="nine columns">
						<p>Before diving into potential solutions, we wanted to deeply understand how users interact with this page. How do they manage their campaign’s designs? How are they organized? What information do users need to launch their campaigns? What currently slows down their workflows? What language do external users use to describe the objects in the UI?</p>
						<img class="case-study-img" src="DBD/portfolio%20assets/DBD-interviewing.jpg">
						<p>To better understand the current deployment workflow and everything simultaneously happening on the backend, my mentor and I conducted interviews with multiple Factual employees who knew the interface and user feedback well. This included PMs and outbound teams that deal directly with Factual clients.</p>

				<div class="design-content-row row">

						<h6>Interview Insights</h6>
					</div>
					<div class="nine columns">
						<p style="font-weight: 600;">Design statuses did not properly communicate where designs were in the deployment process</p>
						<img class="case-study-img" src="DBD/portfolio%20assets/bad-status.png">
						<p>Users found the concept of “design, build, deploy” difficult to understand. This made it hard for users to know what was happening with their campaign’s designs as they were being deployed. and where they were going.</p>

						<p style="font-weight: 600;">Available design actions were difficult for users to understand</p>
						<img class="case-study-img" src="DBD/portfolio%20assets/bad-actions.png">
						<p>Similar to statuses, users found the action of “building” a design to be unintuitive. Many new clients wouldn’t realize they had to click “Build” to trigger the deployment process, and would later be frustrated when designs weren’t delivered to their DSPs.</p>

						<p style="font-weight: 600;">Relevant design information was not easily accessible</p>
						<img class="case-study-img" src="DBD/portfolio%20assets/inaccessible-info.gif">
						<p>Users would often have to leave the experience and go into the designers to find specific metadata that wasn’t readily available in the data table.</p>

						<p style="font-weight: 600;">Users typically want to take action on all designs in a campaign, rather than individual ones</p>
						<img class="case-study-img" src="DBD/portfolio%20assets/inefficient-building.gif">
						<p>To deliver all designs made for a campaign, a user would have to deliver each one individually. This meant the user would have to repeatedly input the same information, resulting in a frustrating and tedious experience.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="design-content-row row">
					<div class="three columns">
						<h6>Ideation & Early Designs</h6>
					</div>
					<div class="nine columns">
						<p>I began by experimenting with different analogies to better communicate designs’ statuses as they moved through the deployment process. I wanted to use terminology that was as non-technical as possible. The analogy that made most sense to me was shipping a package. The package is “prepared” before being shipped. Once shipped, it is “en route,” and is finally “delivered” to the recipient.</p>

						<img class="case-study-img" src="DBD/portfolio%20assets/early-designs.png">

						<p>With a solid concept to work with, I began putting together mid-fi mockups. Once I was comfortable with the mockups, I got them in front of internal users for feedback. In the early stages of the project, open-ended feedback concerning the information and visual hierarchy were extremely helpful. As we honed in on a specific design, we began conducting more focused usability testing. This revealed ways we could communicate status more clearly, organize information, and also brought about an additional feature!</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="design-content-row row">
					<div class="three columns">
						<h6>Keeping Everyone in the Loop</h6>
					</div>
					<div class="nine columns">
						<p>While refining designs, we wanted to better involve PMs and developers in the feedback process. I created a Dropbox Paper doc where I documented design details and functionality of our current designs. The purpose of the doc was to explain the rationale behind design decisions, refine the problem being solved, and most importantly: act as a discussion platform to further refine our designs.</p>

						<img  class="case-study-img" src="DBD/portfolio%20assets/keep-in-loop.png">

						<p>This proved to be very helpful for everyone involved with the project. At a high level, it helped us all to align on big design decisions like how to communicate status. On a more granular level, the doc helped us to better anticipate and handle edge cases that we hadn’t considered early on in the project.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="design-content-row row">
					<div class="three columns">
						<h6>Design Decisions</h6>
					</div>
					<div class="nine columns">
						<p style="font-weight: 600;">Statuses are intuitive and informative</p>
						<img class="case-study-img" src="DBD/portfolio%20assets/statuses.png">
						<p>We wanted to help users understand where their designs were going from an external perspective. At the same time, we wanted to abstract away complex internal processes and convey a more streamlined and simplified delivery process. After brainstorming and testing other concepts, we found “Deliver” to be most intuitive. This informed how we’d communicate statuses and refine copy for the rest of the UI.</p>

						<p style="font-weight: 600;">Delivery, made simple</p>
						<img class="case-study-img" src="DBD/portfolio%20assets/delivery.png">
						<p>With clearer statuses, delivering designs became much easier and quicker. Changes in information hierarchy and visual treatment improved the delivery modal’s usability and helped make the delivery process more intuitive. Requiring users to select a destination also meant that designs would no longer sit in an interim “Build” phase. Instead, they would immediately be queued for delivery which significantly decreased delivery time. At the same time, we were able to showcase Factual’s integrations (another ask from PMs)!</p>

						<p style="font-weight: 600;">Improved information accessibility</p>
						<img class="case-study-img" src="DBD/portfolio%20assets/information-accessibility.png">
						<p>We wanted to make it easy to find information relating to a design without having to leave the current UI. This meant surfacing design metadata without cluttering the main data table. We came up with the sidebar feature where users can find helpful metadata, status history, and high-level content inside the design.</p>
						<img class="case-study-img" src="DBD/portfolio%20assets/copy-details.png">
						<p>We also introduced a feature that would remove the need for outbound teams to click into multiple designs, copy metadata for each design, and send them to clients.</p>

						<p style="font-weight: 600;">Get marketing campaigns live, faster</p>
						<img class="case-study-img" src="DBD/portfolio%20assets/bulk-actions.gif">
						<p>When users manage a marketing campaign, there are usually multiple designs associated with it. Users can now use bulk-actions on all designs within a campaign, rather than one at a time. With faster deliveries, users can focus on making the most out of their data.</p>

						<h6>Building the Redesign</h6>
					</div>
					<div class="nine columns">
						<p>After we finished designing the interface, I worked with the PM and engineers to define a MVP that could be launched by the end of my internship. We preserved the functionality of the interface pre-redesign, included essential new features, and stripped the rest.</p>
						<p>I put together designs for the MVP and created documentation for the front-dev team to use when building the interface.</p>
						<img class="case-study-img" src="DBD/portfolio%20assets/documentation.png">

				</div>
				<div class="design-content-row row">
					<div class="three columns">
						<h6>Takeaways</h6>
					</div>
					<div class="nine columns">
						<p>I came away from this project learning about my strengths and weaknesses as a designer. Some of the main things I learned were how to simplify complex technical ideas, how to get all stakeholders involved in conversations about design decisions, how to get better feedback and to do it often, and how to work closely with developers in building out designs.</p>
						<p>One constraint we had to work within during the project was limited access to external users for feedback/testing. To better work within these constraints, we could have worked more closely with the Revenue and Partner Services teams who interface directly with our users. To better address these constraints, we could have acknowledged these drawbacks more upfront and been more proactive about anticipating their effects on our work.</p>
