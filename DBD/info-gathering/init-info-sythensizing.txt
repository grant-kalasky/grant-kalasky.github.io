# Design Build Deploy
# Info Synthesize
# 5-23-18


# Design page
	
	# Main objective
	Make UI that is intuitive for nontechnical, external users

	# Initial feedback
	External users don't understand objects "design, build, deploy"
		user goal: 'I want this thing I built to be sent to place X'


	# Specifics

	1. Layout/table 
		Surface information that helps make users' jobs easier (i.e. Reach)

		Give more intel about the designs -> make users feel good about being on the homepage

		"Awkward that you have to go into different my design pages for proximity and audience" (Ellis)

		give users a way to organize things, are there ways to associate designs with compaigns (Ellis)

		Changes:
			1. Navigation - make tabs match visual treatment of proximity v2

	2. Statuses <- something more intuitive than 'build'
		Goal: help users understand where their segment is going from an EXTERNAL perspective, make it seem like the process is super simple/streamlined

		currently showing an "internal" representation of the state, not how the customer thinks about itSurf

		statuses don't reflect what's happening with deployment (someone should log into their home and see the status of their designs) -> external should know if the design is: (1) building or (2) activated (Ellis)

		Idea of a tracker similar to uber eats/postmates (Mike)


	3. Actions
		Goal: Make all actions clear/easy to understand for all users (esp. non-technical users)

		a. Build (primary action)
			"New clients don't realize they have to click 'Build'" (Matt K)
			"people dont need to know that "build" is a thing - users typically dont conceptualize this correctly" (Mike)

			"Users sometime don't request to build things and they dont know why it doesn't show up on the trade desk" (Ellis)

			Where should build be developed? -> SHOWCASE INTEGRATIONS 
				this is a big differentiator for factual <- how can we surface/highlight this to users, maybe logos?

			Potentially make "select target" a mandatory action for a design to get built (Ellis)
				Designs shouldn't sit in build state

			orgs have pieces of metadata associated with them, would be helpful to have this info autopopulate fields when users click "build" (Ellis)

			Should have two steps for users: (1) save design ("Deliver" or "Ship") and (2) ship to destination. If user wants to build, they can do that from admin (Alfred)


		b. Editing designs
			If user makes modifications to design, they need to reprocess and redeploy (this might need to be a change made in the designer itself rather than in the "my design" screen)

			Could be simplified by idea of 'refresh' button <- need to make it clear to user that this action needs to be completed after modifying (e.g. before exiting editor, have dialogue to refresh and save changes)

			Being able to edit the design name, targeting code and exchange of the duplicated designs without having to click into every design to do it (Elise) <- could take the form of a pencil icon and live in the corresponding cell to allow inline editing


		c. Duplicate designs
			See Elise's comment above in "Editing designs" section

			use duplicate icon used in proximity v2??


		d. Share designs

		e. Create new design 

			Current button is in top-right, next to search bar -> should be moved to a clearer place for users to find

		f. Bulk actions (duplicate, build, etc.) INTERNAL

			Have the ability to select multiple designs and click Build along with where to deploy 
			Save hundreds of designs under one campagin, give functionality to "bulk" approach to organizing (Ellis)

		g. Download
			Potentially get rid of this feature (internal doesn't seem to use it and it's not shown for external users)

		IDEA: Nest actions in a dropdown and use 3 dot icon instead to save space


### Edge cases <- what are all of them?
