# Notes

Workflow:
Design -> Build -> Request deploy -> Activate
  |

Save

My designs

  v
Hit Build


1. Save -> comeout of page they're on which is a complpete waste, more actions make it more likely to lose a user
	suggestion: maybe allow someone to just hit build rather than save

2. Pieces of metadata associated with an org -> would be great to have this saved
	suggestion: shift "my designs" an incorporate more of a profile
	autopopulate when you hit build
	'i know you' - makes user feel nice

3. My Design 
	this should be a home for all that shit
	awkward that you have to go into different my design pages for proximity and audience
	give more intel about the designs -> make users feel good about being in their "homepage"

4. Build + Request Deploy
	Currently: design can sit in "built state" - it's not making money here, useless for factual
	If you select your target, it will put design in request deployment state



5. Activate (this action exists in the deployment UI - 2 other UIs here)


6. Autodeploy/autoactivate
	Target - define preferenes to autodeploy certain designs (e.g. designs under 200mb get autodeployed)


Personal frustrations:
	- target (DSP) should always be selected - segments shouldn't sit in build state -> factual isn't making any money here
	- requrie target for any designs to be built

	- statuses don't reflect what's happening with deployment (someone should log into their home and see the status of their designs) -> external should know if the design is: (1) building or (2) activated

	- Users sometime don't request to build things and they dont know why it doesn't show up on the trade desk

Statuses: stay in "building" until it's "activated" -> make users think that this process is super simple


# Questions

Q: What ways do you interact with this UI differently than someone like Matt (a delivery manager)?

	A: Workflow isn't super different

Q: What information associated with segments would be most helpful to see first? We're thinking about 
(# of places, # of device IDs, showing what's more inside the design)

	A: Reach probably, somewhere to see "store information" (kind of like a profile)

	For "my orgs", maybe showing most popular designs, designs making the most money

	Tie revenue into this somewhere 

	THINK: give users a way to organize things, are there ways to associate designs with compaigns

	Save hundreds of designs under one campagin, give functionality to "bulk" approach to organizing

	Look into things that give you a "homey" feeling
	in terms of ad tech, think about it in terms of campaings too

	give users information/stuff to take action


Actions:
1. Talk to Mike about non-onprime examples
