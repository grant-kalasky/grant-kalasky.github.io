# Notes

Click build -> open modal 
	information is optional, personally don't check the text box information (more for self-served clients)

Frustrations:
1. cant select multiple designs and send them all at once
2. build out a segment and need to duplicate and share it to a different account (NEED: batch selection and actions -> this is more internal though, would have to be strict bc of permissions)

No activate button for deployment manager tab of Admin section

Client questions/commencts/concerns:
- for new clients, they don't realize they have to click "Build"
- if someone edits a design, they dont know they have to reprocess it and redeploy (clicking build again)

when building out segments, unless they have an exchange name, we don't know what 

have a huge location list, and are unable to calc reach so we don't know how large the segment will be unless it's fully built (file size, not device count)
	1. 
	2. huge segment allows teams to make tweaks, meet DSP needs better

Download feature isn't used that often (idk if clients see this)



Questions
