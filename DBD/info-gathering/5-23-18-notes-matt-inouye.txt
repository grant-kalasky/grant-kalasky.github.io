want to deliver segment to add it to a live campaign (DSP)

metadata associated with segments

1. make it easier for users to see what they have, then take an action
2. showcasing integrations -> this is a big differentiator for factual (how can we surface/highlight this to users, maybe logos?)
3. Look and feel

Help users understand where their segment is going -> help understand the state of their delivery (sometimes takes a few days for the data to show up) <- there is currently a pipeline 
	"ive created my segment, when is it going to show up on the trade desk"
	currently showing an "internal" representation of the state, not how the customer thinks about it

Most complex: communicating states to the user (changes how to structure and store these segments)

Internal factual users are the power users - have way more designs than external users

More catering to external users - take the functionality on the current interface and move it to an internal tool

Timeline - Finish designs early Q3 (July)

People to talk to: any delivery managers (Elise)


Questions

Q: "Internal Factual employees are on "my design" pages a lot, some features are deeply internal and should be moved to Admin tool"... Which features specifically?

	A: 1. we are using internal states (design -> build -> deploy) 
	2. "sharing designs" feature - premissions are based around orgs (e.g. ad agencies w/ 10 users), inside factual we may create an audience in that agency's org but share it with them

	Take a design that was created by factual but shared with the client/org

	A workaround for work-based permissions

	Download - don't want to permission to external users (more of an internal action) <- is there another way to accomplish this or make this simpler?


Q: User Storeis #6 - user wants to request delivery of a segment so they can build a campaign... what does it mean to request delivery of segment?

	A: This is raw data (proximity is geo data, audience is device id's) - users interact with these with a fancy UI where they set up their campaign


Q: From user stories, it seems like there are 2 use cases for external users (geopulse users and delivery managers)... is this correct?

	A: Delivery manager functionality would be moved to admin tools

Q: What kind of metadata is most important

	A: We have a concept of state, there are a couple different objects in terms of thinking about the segment 
		1. design object (name of segment, ID, who created it)
		2. build object (how many devices were returned, when did it finish)
		3. deployment object (what platform do i want to send this to, ***DEPLOYMENT STATUS IS IMPORTANT***)


Action items:

1. Get schema from Matt
